					<h4>Our Founder</h4>
					<br>
					<img id="mb" src="images/Owner.jpg" alt="Owner">

						<p>Armando Gort, founder of HorsePower for Kids, was born in Havana, Cuba. He came to the United States in 1970. As a small child in Cuba, Armando dreamed of coming to the United States and owning his own horse farm, where children could experience their love of animals in a real farm setting. Armando’s dream came true in 1994. Since then, Armando has welcomed children to his farm from all over Hillsborough and Pinellas County, as well as children from all over the world. Armando started riding at the age of five. Since then he has achieved expertise in Dressage, Western, Hunter, and Jumpers. Armando’s philosophy is: “Dreams do come true. Along with hard work and perseverance, anything can be accomplished.” This is what children learn when they visit the farm.“I believe I was born with a fascination for animals.</p>

						<br>

						<p>As a toddler, I would not go to sleep without my pet goat. As a child, while other kids were at the playground, I would be with my mom building cages and feeding all my animals. At the age of 5, I got my first pony and my love of horses began. There’s never been a time in my life when I did not have horses or other animals. As I’ve gotten older and I look back, I realize that it’s the time with my animals and my family that I cherish the most. Long forgotten are my trips to attractions and far away places. The time I spent with animals are my most cherished moments. I invite you to come to the farm and make your own memories to last a lifetime. Many children in the Tampa Bay area never get the chance to experience horses because of financial difficulties. </p>

						<br>

						<p>“My goal is to change that for as many children as possible.”</p>

						<br>

						<p>Thank you so much for your support!</p>

			<h4>Our Mission</h4>

				<p><b>HorsePower for Kids, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization </b>that provides a farm and petting zoo so that everyone can have the opportunity to benefit from interaction with animals and horses. We provide fun, educational opportunities for children and adults to interact with and care for animals that have been rescued from a variety of situations. In our experience, working with animals enriches our lives. Through animals, children transform into young adults, learning responsibility and respect. These interactions build character, foster relationships, and allow us to become more open as individuals. At our farm, we strive to provide these experiences to the public and share our love for animals with everyone. We enjoy sharing our animals with anyone who will benefit including children who can not afford to visit us due to finances can attend free of charge on scholarship; we also rescue unwanted and injured animals. We are self supporting, therefore being open to the public is how we are able to house and care for hundreds of beautiful creatures. Thank you so much for your support!</p>
